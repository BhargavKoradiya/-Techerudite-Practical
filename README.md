# Techerudite-Practical

- Here is my Practical project. in this project still more functionality can add but I created like this as mentioned in Mail. and this is I have done with MySQL raw queries, I not used "sequelize" but I can use it also for more easier to do queries. so Please check this and if any mistake then please let me know.

- Here is the details regarding how run the Application.

1. Get clone from my repository pressing "<> Code" -> copy the HTTPS url
2. Open that folder in VS code Editor 
3. Open Tirminal and run command "npm i" (Don't forget to run this commant after getting clone of project).
4. You need to go "http://localhost/phpmyadmin" and create new Database called "ragistration_system" (Use this name only for create database)
5. After this come back to VS code and run this command in tirminal "npm start"
6. now server is start successfully and now you can check all The APIs

Thank you :)
